# Rangeland-Carbon
Repository for the Rangeland Carbon project. The repository is split into two components.
1. Remote Sensing
2. Modeling

'remote-sensing' contains the code to download MODIS and Landsat imagery and fuse them together with the STARFM algorithm. This directory also handles covariate and landcover downloads from Google Earth Engine, as well as all processing required to generate RCTM input data.

'modeling' contains code related to the RCTM model and parameters.
